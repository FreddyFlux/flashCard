# üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation Overview

This is a comprehensive security checklist for implementing authentication and data isolation with Clerk.

## Architecture Overview

```
User Authentication (Clerk)
    ‚Üì
User owns Decks (via userId in decksTable)
    ‚Üì
Decks contain Cards (via deckId foreign key)
    ‚Üì
Security Model: Users ‚Üí Decks ‚Üí Cards
```

## Security Rule Files Reference

1. **[auth-security.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/auth-security.mdc)** - Core authentication principles (always applies)
2. **[api-security.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/api-security.mdc)** - API route security patterns
3. **[database-security.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/database-security.mdc)** - Database operation security
4. **[component-security.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/component-security.mdc)** - Client-side component security
5. **[server-actions-security.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/server-actions-security.mdc)** - Server actions security

## Key Security Implementation Points

### üîê Authentication Flow

```typescript
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

const { userId } = await auth();
if (!userId) {
  return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
}
```

### üîç Data Access Pattern

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Always filter by authenticated user
const userDecks = await db
  .select()
  .from(decksTable)
  .where(eq(decksTable.userId, userId));
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Ownership Verification

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Verify ownership before operations
const deck = await db
  .select()
  .from(decksTable)
  .where(and(eq(decksTable.id, deckId), eq(decksTable.userId, userId)));
```

## Pre-Implementation Security Checklist

- [ ] Clerk authentication properly configured in [middleware.ts](mdc:src/middleware.ts)
- [ ] Database schema includes `userId` fields for ownership tracking
- [ ] All API routes implement authentication checks
- [ ] All database operations filter by authenticated user
- [ ] Components handle authentication states appropriately
- [ ] Server actions include proper validation and authorization

## Post-Implementation Security Verification

- [ ] Cannot access other users' decks by manipulating URLs
- [ ] Cannot access other users' cards through any route
- [ ] API returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] API returns 404 for unauthorized data access attempts
- [ ] Database queries always include user context
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Common Security Vulnerabilities to Test

1. **Direct object reference**: Can user access `/api/decks/123` for deck they don't own?
2. **Authentication bypass**: What happens when auth token is missing/invalid?
3. **Privilege escalation**: Can user modify other users' data?
4. **Information disclosure**: Do error messages reveal sensitive data?
5. **Input validation**: Are all inputs properly sanitized?

## Emergency Security Response

If a security vulnerability is discovered:

1. **Immediately** revoke access to affected systems
2. Audit logs for potential data breaches
3. Fix the vulnerability following security rules
4. Test the fix thoroughly
5. Deploy the fix as priority
6. Review similar patterns across codebase
